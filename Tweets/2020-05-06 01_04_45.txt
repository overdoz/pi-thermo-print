A drive with three 16 year 
old mothers - 
Busy, noisy, crowded and 
loud. that’s how I would 
remember the Situation when 
I was tramping through 
Ecuador. The three women are
truly struggling. Struggling
growing up as teens with 
kids. Forced to forget youth
ab being a child or a teen. 
They are mothers. They won’t
be ever alone. Ever.
